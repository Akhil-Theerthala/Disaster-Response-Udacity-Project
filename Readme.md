# 2. Project Motivation
This web application is a project in Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this project, I analyze disaster data to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. I find a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events.

I create a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that I can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency. I split the data into a training set and a test set. Then,I create a machine learning pipeline that uses NLTK, as well as scikit-learn's Pipeline and GridSearchCV to output a final model. Finally, I export the model to a pickle file.

The project also include a web app with bootstap and Flask where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. disaster graph2 The web app also displays visualizations of the data as follows: disaster graph1

# 4.Instructions:

1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
         `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
     `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
